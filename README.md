### What I learned

The project is majorly a bignners level project but it was interesting because I reserch on how i could write code for "Why Us" section.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<pre>
Tutorials by industry experts
Peer &amp; expert code review
Coding exercises
Access to our GitHub repos
Community forum
Flashcard decks
New videos every week
</pre>
```

It's a HTML tag which will be displayed the text exactly as written in the HTML source code.
